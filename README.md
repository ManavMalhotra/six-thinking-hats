# six-thinking-hats

Functionality/Purpose of the Six Thinking Hats React Native Project:

The Six Thinking Hats React Native project is designed to facilitate productive and collaborative decision-making discussions among a group of participants. This project aims to streamline the process by using the Six Thinking Hats methodology, a technique that encourages structured thinking from different perspectives. Here are the key functionalities and purposes of this project:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can log in or register using their Google OAuth credentials, ensuring secure access to the platform.

2. **Session Management:**
   - Users have the option to either create a new thinking session or join an existing one.
   - When a user creates a session, they are designated as the "admin" and are assigned the Blue Hat role.

3. **Role Assignment:**
   - Participants who join a session initially do not have specific thinking hats assigned to them.
   - The admin/user who created the session has the authority to assign thinking hats to participants.

4. **Structured Discussion:**
   - The Six Thinking Hats methodology is applied to guide the discussion process. Each hat represents a different thinking style:
     - Blue Hat: Admin (session creator) controls the session and sets the agenda.
     - White Hat: Represents factual, data-driven thinking.
     - Red Hat: Reflects emotions and gut feelings.
     - Black Hat: Encourages critical and cautious thinking.
     - Yellow Hat: Focuses on positive, optimistic viewpoints.
     - Green Hat: Promotes creative and innovative ideas.

5. **Time Allocation:**
   - The admin allocates a specific amount of time for the entire session, e.g., 20 minutes.
   - This total time is divided equally among the participants who have joined the session.
   - Participants are prompted to share their thoughts or ideas within their allocated time slots, fostering efficient and balanced participation.

6. **Discussion Monitoring:**
   - The platform allows the admin to monitor the discussion progress, ensuring that each participant has an opportunity to contribute.

7. **Visual Feedback:**
   - The platform provides visual cues to indicate which hat is currently in use, helping participants stay on track with their assigned thinking style.

8. **Save and Review:**
   - The project enables the admin to save the discussion results for future reference and analysis.

9. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - The React Native framework ensures a user-friendly and cross-platform interface for seamless access on both Android and iOS devices.

Overall, this project promotes structured and productive discussions, encourages diverse perspectives, and facilitates decision-making by implementing the Six Thinking Hats methodology. It aims to enhance collaboration and creativity within teams or groups using a mobile application.
